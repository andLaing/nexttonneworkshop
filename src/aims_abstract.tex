\abstract{The NEXT collaboration has demonstrated the strength of gaseous xenon TPCs with electroluminescent amplification as a technology for the observation of neutrino-less double beta decay. The first results using xenon enriched to 91\% in the double beta isotope are due in 2019 with the 100~kg scale detector due to come online in 2020. This workshop aims to select baseline designs for a detector with fiducial mass in the region of 500 -- 1000~kg of xenon. Using simulated MC data we will assess the feasibility of baseline designs both in terms of size and of the technologies for the read-out of the detector.}
